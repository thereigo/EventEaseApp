## Summary

While Copilot is a powerful tool, it has some limitations. It sometimes generates incorrect or nonsensical code, and it can be biased or produce offensive code. Additionally, it may not always understand the context of the code being written, which can lead to errors. Despite these limitations, Copilot can still be a valuable tool for developers, as long as its output is carefully reviewed and tested.
For me copilot and .net is like alpha testing version, it works but with a lot of artifacts like creating files not in project folder, not understanding that for this component need to use @rendermode, not uses and fix nullables, can create from different versions of .net, like logon.aspx.cs ðŸ¤¦ and e.t.c.
Overall, Copilot can improve code quality, and save time on routine tasks.
